If you wish to use the pre-trained model, rather than waiting hours, then 
copy /Model/sinking-feeling.ai to c:\temp BEFORE running.

This application requires .net6 and Visual Studio 2022 (Community works).

1. Download https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
2. Download the source-code as a ZIP. 
3. Save it where you like - I tend to use c:\repos\ai\sinking-feeling, feel free to choose a better folder.
4. Open the solution, and enjoy!

Any problems? Post a comment on my blog, and I will happily try to assist.
